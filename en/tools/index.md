# Introduction

Several tools I made for web development.

- [drag-scroll](/en/tools/drag-scroll)

    An npm library that provides drag scrolling for elements with rich behavior controls.

- [handled-resizable](/en/tools/handled-resizable)

    An npm library that provides free drag with handles for resizing elements.

- [stick-element](/en/tools/stick-element)

    An npm library that implements more extensive CSS sticky behavior.
